# sda-clear-port-assignment

This script takes in a .csv file format as an input to automate clearing static assignment of interfaces that would otherwise need to be manually cleared from a DNAC GUI. An example excel sheet is added ('sample_host_clear_sheet.csv') to show the expected format - hostname, interface name.
